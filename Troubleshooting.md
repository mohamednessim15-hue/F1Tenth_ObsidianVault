# Resetting Ubuntu

```
If you prefer staying in a terminal (PowerShell or Command Prompt), you can "unregister" the distribution. This is instantaneous.

1. Open **PowerShell** as Administrator.
    
2. Run this command to see your installed distro name: `wsl --list`
    
3. Run the following to wipe it (replace `Ubuntu` with your distro name if it's different): `wsl --unregister Ubuntu`
    
4. To start over, just type `ubuntu` in PowerShell or launch it from your Start Menu. It will behave as if it’s being installed for the first time, asking you for a **new username and password**.

so to completely reset ubuntu, i did:
1. `wsl --unregister Ubuntu-22.04`
2. opening ubuntu again from its windows app icon.

# Setting up Docker

after downloading docker and enabling ***WSL Integration***, 

go back to your **Ubuntu-22.04 terminal** (the one you just created). You don't need to install the Docker engine inside Ubuntu itself; the Windows app handles the heavy lifting.
Run this command to see if Ubuntu can "see" Docker:
```
docker --version
```

Then, run a test container to make sure everything is flowing correctly:
```
docker run hello-world
```
If you see a message saying _"Hello from Docker!"_, you are officially set up.
### Permission Denied error

 the classic "Permission Denied." This happens because, even though Docker Desktop is linked, your new Ubuntu user doesn't have the necessary "keys" to talk to the Docker engine yet.

The `docker.sock` file is owned by the `root` user and the `docker` group. Since your user **\[Name]** is brand new, we need to add you to that group.

### The Fix

Run this command in your Ubuntu terminal:
```
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
**Crucial Step:** This change won't take effect until you "log out" and back in. Since this is WSL, the easiest way to do that is to shut down WSL entirely from Windows to force a refresh.

1. **Close** your Ubuntu terminal.
    
2. Open **PowerShell** and run: `wsl --shutdown`
    
3. **Re-open** your Ubuntu terminal.
### Deleting all docker containers for a clean reset

```
docker system prune -a --volumes
```
This will delete all the volumes and containers on docker.

# Rocker "Not on PATH" Warning

Run these two commands in your terminal. The first adds the directory to your configuration file, and the second activates it immediately.

1. **Add to your profile:**
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
    ```
    
2. **Refresh the terminal:**
    
    Bash
    
    ```
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```
    

---

### Verify it worked

Now, try to see if Ubuntu can find `rocker` without you providing the full path:

Bash

```
which rocker
```

It should return `/home/[USER]/.local/bin/rocker`. If it does, you're all set to run your F1Tenth containers.

# Installing F1Tenth_gym_ros

https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_gym_ros?tab=readme-ov-file

using the rocker steps ***only*** , NOT native, only following  >> With an NVIDIA gpu

# Running the rocker container

To open the container, run:
```
rocker --nvidia --x11 --volume .:/sim_ws/src/f1tenth_gym_ros -- f1tenth_gym_ros 
```
MUST BE IN THE Cloned Repo Folder of `f1tenth_gym_ros`
# Launching the Simulation (Inside the container)

Using `tmux`, have 2 panels and run:
	
```
source /opt/ros/foxy/setup.bash && source install/local_setup.bash
```
	
run this inside of `sim_ws` (Only if you changed settings such as map path):
```
colcon build	
```
	
```
ros2 launch f1tenth_gym_ros gym_bridge_launch.py
```
and
```
ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
```
on the other panel.

# Installing VSCode in Linux Terminal

You should not install VS Code _inside_ the Linux terminal. Instead, follow these steps:

1. **Download & Install on Windows:** Go to the [official VS Code site](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and run the Windows `.exe` installer.
    
2. **Add to PATH:** During installation, ensure **"Add to PATH"** is checked.
    
3. **Install the WSL Extension:** Open VS Code on Windows, go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`), and search for **"WSL"** (by Microsoft). Install it.
    
4. **Open from Terminal:** Now, go back to your terminal (image 1) and type:
    
    ```
    code .
    ```
    
    VS Code will open on your Windows desktop but will be "remotely" connected to your files in `/sim_ws/src`.

## Enable VS Code in WSL

Since you already have VS Code open on Windows (as seen in the background of your image), follow these steps to make the terminal recognize it:

1. **In Windows VS Code:** Press `Ctrl + Shift + X` to open the **Extensions** view.
    
2. **Search & Install:** Find the extension named **"WSL"** by Microsoft and install it.
    
3. **Check Path:** In Windows, search for "Environment Variables" in the Start menu. Ensure that the path to your VS Code installation (usually `C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\bin`) is in your system **Path**.
    
4. **Restart the Terminal:** Completely close your WSL terminal (the black window) and open it again.

You need to move that path into the existing `Path` variable rather than having it as its own separate variable.

1. In the **Environment Variables** window (from your image), look at the **System variables** section.
    
2. Find the variable named **Path** (not the one you created) and click **Edit**.
    
3. Click **New** and paste the path from your screenshot: `C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\bin`
    
4. **Important:** Make sure the path ends in `\bin`. The `bin` folder contains the actual `code` command script that WSL looks for.
    
5. Click **OK** on all windows to save.
